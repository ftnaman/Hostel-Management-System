# Hostel-Management-System
This Mess/Hostel Management System streamlines accommodation tasks for students and hostel owners. Users can find hostels, manage expenses, and locate roommates, while admins handle listings and user data. With a modular, scalable design, it's ideal for academic or residential use in real-world environments.
